                [Verse 1]<br>
                Remember when you ran away<br>
                And I got on my knees<br>
                And begged you not to leave because I'd go berserk?<br>
                Well, you left me anyhow<br>
                And then the days got worse and worse<br>
                And now, you see, I've gone completely out of my mind<br>
                <br>
                <i class="fas fa-music"></i>
                [Chorus]<br>
                And they're coming to take me away, ha-ha<br>
                They're coming to take me away, ho-ho, hee-hee, ha-ha<br>
                To the funny farm<br>
                Where life is beautiful all the time<br>
                And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats<br>
                And they're coming to take me away, ha-ha<br>

                [Verse 2]<br>
                You thought it was a joke<br>
                And so you laughed, you laughed when I had said<br>
                That losing you would make me flip my lid<br>
                Right? You know you laughed, I heard you laugh<br>
                You laughed, you laughed and laughed and then you left<br>
                But now you know I'm utterly mad<br>
                <br>

                And basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes<br>
                And they're coming to take me away, ha-ha<br>

                [Verse 3]<br>
                I cooked your food, I cleaned your house<br>
                And this is how you pay me back<br>
                For all my kind unselfish loving deeds?<br>
                Huh? Well, you just wait, they'll find you yet<br>
                And when they do, they'll put you in<br>
                The ASPCA, you mangy mutt<br>
