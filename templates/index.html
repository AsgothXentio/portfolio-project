                [Verse 1]<br>
                Remember when you ran away<br>
                And I got on my knees<br>
                And begged you not to leave because I'd go berserk?<br>
                Well, you left me anyhow<br>
                And then the days got worse and worse<br>
                And now, you see, I've gone completely out of my mind<br>

                To the funny farm<br>

                And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats<br>

                You thought it was a joke<br>
                And so you laughed, you laughed when I had said<br>
                That losing you would make me flip my lid<br>
                Right? You know you laughed, I heard you laugh<br>
                You laughed, you laughed and laughed and then you left<br>
                But now you know I'm utterly mad<br>

                        A bit similiar to the number guessing game, but i still enjoyed building it. And just to be totally clich√©...
